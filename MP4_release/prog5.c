 * This function should use the function sscanf to find the integer seed value from the 
 * string seed_str, then initialize the random number generator by calling srand with the integer
 * seed value. To be valid, exactly one integer must be entered by the user, anything else is invalid. 
 * INPUTS: seed_str -- a string (array of characters) entered by the user, containing the random seed
 * OUTPUTS: none
 * RETURN VALUE: 0 if the given string is invalid (string contains anything
 *               other than a single integer), or 1 if string is valid (contains one integer)
 * SIDE EFFECTS: initializes pseudo-random number generation using the function srand. Prints "set_seed: invalid seed\n"
 *               if string is invalid. Prints nothing if it is valid.

//    int seed;

//    The sscanf statement below reads the integer into seed. 
//    sscanf (seed_str, "%d%1s", &seed, post)
//    If there is no integer, seed will not be set. If something else is read after the integer, it will go into "post".
//    The return value of sscanf indicates the number of items read succesfully.
//    When the user has typed in only an integer, only 1 item should be read sucessfully. 
//    Check that the return value is 1 to ensure the user enters only an integer.

 *               The function must calculate the number of perfect and misplaced matches
 *               for a guess, given the solution recorded earlier by start_game
 *               The guess must be valid (contain only 4 integers, within the range 1-8). If it is valid
 *               the number of correct and incorrect matches should be printed, using the following format
 *               "With guess %d, you got %d perfect matches and %d misplaced matches.\n"
 *               If valid, the guess_number should be incremented.
 *               If invalid, the error message "make_guess: invalid guess\n" should be printed and 0 returned.
 *               For an invalid guess, the guess_number is not incremented.
 * INPUTS: guess_str -- a string consisting of the guess typed by the user
 * OUTPUTS: the following are only valid if the function returns 1 (A valid guess)
 *          *one -- the first guess value (between 1 and 8)
 *          *two -- the second guess value (between 1 and 8)
 *          *three -- the third guess value (between 1 and 8)

 * RETURN VALUE: 1 if the guess string is valid (the guess contains exactly four
 *               numbers between 1 and 8), or 0 if it is invalid
 * SIDE EFFECTS: prints (using printf) the number of matches found and increments guess_number(valid guess) 
 *               or an error message (invalid guess)
 *               (NOTE: the output format MUST MATCH EXACTLY, check the wiki writeup)
