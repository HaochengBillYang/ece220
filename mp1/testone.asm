	.STRINGZ "When I was young, I learned the sentence that people used to learn typing: \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\"  If you look carefully, or less than carefully at a correctly-produced histogram, you will notice that it contains all of the letters in the English language.  This aspect gives the sentence its value in teaching typing skills.  Can you type it, I wonder?"
