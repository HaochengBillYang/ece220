*** The entry room of the infamous ECE190 'surreal' game about finishing
*** your MP2 as an ECE190 student...

Being a bright ECE undergraduate on the prestigious UIUC campus, you have
decided to enroll in ECE199SJP, subjecting yourself to sleep deprivation 
and the debilitating effects of 'Engineering humor' in search of a deeper
understanding of computers and their design.

You stand in the Bardeen Quad.  You stand in the rain.  Recalling that
standing in the rain can make you sick, you briefly consider trying to 
get sick instead of finishing tonight's MP, but decide to retain that
option for later.

You can (1) head into Everitt, (2) wave to the Engineer and enter Grainger,
or (3) go down to Green Street.
